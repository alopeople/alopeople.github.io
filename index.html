								<h4 style="text-align:center">Clouds, services, servers </h4>
								<h4>What does it do?</h4>
								<p> Cloud has many different applications in the field of computer, for example, cloud server, cloud service, cloud computing and so on. Simply put, it is more convenient for us to use computers in the cloud. I believe that all of the people use iPhone heard or used up, this is a kind of cloud services, he can help you to put his hand on the video, photos, contacts, etc. all kinds of information posted on apple's servers, the advantage is, when you are lost or changed a new mobile phone, you can directly through up to download all the information on the phone before to new devices. With the progress of The Times, now people can not leave the computer, it has a large number of users, in order to protect the privacy of their computers, people like to install anti-virus software on their computers, this is related to cloud security, what is cloud security? Cloud security means that the more users, the more secure each user, because such a large number of users, enough to cover every corner of the Internet, as long as a site is hacked or a new Trojan appeared, it will be immediately intercepted. Cloud security monitors software anomalies, obtains Internet viruses, pushes them to the server for analysis, and finally distributes solutions to each client. This is like your computer reminding you to upgrade the system and fix some bugs. Finally, the cloud is being applied to gaming. Many fans of the game will spend a lot of money on the computer, in order to improve the performance of the computer in exchange for more extreme gaming experience. This year, Google announced cloud gaming platform STADIA, unlike in the past, he is not in the form of a physical host devices, STADIA is a completely cloud-based gaming platform, it will be most of the processing, the server render job to spread all over the world, and then through high-speed network, the interactive game available images back to the local, the user's operation also can cause back in real time and the cloud. This means that when you don't need expensive equipment, all you need is a better computer, and a better network. </p>
								<h4>What is the likely impact? </h4>
								<p>One of the advantages of cloud service is cost saving. In a home enterprise, cloud service enables the company not to invest in similar physical resources. That is to say, the company does not need to spend money on its own server, and employees can use all the resources of the cloud to do more efficient work. The cloud features the ability to access another application over the network without actually downloading it, saving more disk space. On the other hand, when companies need more storage space, they only need to add a virtual server from the cloud, which is much easier than installing and configuring a server in real life. The downside of the cloud is the occasional loss of data. Of course, that's only in a few cases. Even so, most companies try to store key information themselves, rather than uploading it to the cloud. </p>
								<h4>How will this affect you? </h4>
								<p>For me, I am a person who likes technology and games. So I use cloud services a lot in real life. When my phone is full, I can upload resources to the cloud, freeing up more storage for my phone, rather than deleting them. Or when I get a new phone or tablet, I can use the cloud to transfer data more easily. In terms of games, I am looking forward to Google STADIA platform very much. As I said before, I no longer need to spend a lot of money to buy game equipment, but only need a better network. All in all, I think cloud greatly facilitates our life.</p>
