								<h4 style="text-align:center">Clouds, services, servers </h4>
<								<p> Cloud has many different applications in the field of computer, for example, cloud server, cloud service, cloud computing and so on. Simply put, it is more convenient for us to use computers in the cloud. I believe that all of the people use iPhone heard or used up, this is a kind of cloud services, he can help you to put his hand on the video, photos, contacts, etc. all kinds of information posted on apple's servers, the advantage is, when you are lost or changed a new mobile phone, you can directly through up to download all the information on the phone before to new devices. With the progress of The Times, now people can not leave the computer, it has a large number of users, in order to protect the privacy of their computers, people like to install anti-virus software on their computers, this is related to cloud security, what is cloud security? Cloud security means that the more users, the more secure each user, because such a large number of users, enough to cover every corner of the Internet, as long as a site is hacked or a new Trojan appeared, it will be immediately intercepted. Cloud security monitors software anomalies, obtains Internet viruses, pushes them to the server for analysis, and finally distributes solutions to each client. This is like your computer reminding you to upgrade the system and fix some bugs. Finally, the cloud is being applied to gaming. Many fans of the game will spend a lot of money on the computer, in order to improve the performance of the computer in exchange for more extreme gaming experience. This year, Google announced cloud gaming platform STADIA, unlike in the past, he is not in the form of a physical host devices, STADIA is a completely cloud-based gaming platform, it will be most of the processing, the server render job to spread all over the world, and then through high-speed network, the interactive game available images back to the local, the user's operation also can cause back in real time and the cloud. This means that when you don't need expensive equipment, all you need is a better computer, and a better network. </p>
								<h4>What is the likely impact? </h4>
								<p>One of the advantages of cloud service is cost saving. In a home enterprise, cloud service enables the company not to invest in similar physical resources. That is to say, the company does not need to spend money on its own server, and employees can use all the resources of the cloud to do more efficient work. The cloud features the ability to access another application over the network without actually downloading it, saving more disk space. On the other hand, when companies need more storage space, they only need to add a virtual server from the cloud, which is much easier than installing and configuring a server in real life. The downside of the cloud is the occasional loss of data. Of course, that's only in a few cases. Even so, most companies try to store key information themselves, rather than uploading it to the cloud. </p>
								
								<h4>How will this affect you? </h4>
								<p>For me, I am a person who likes technology and games. So I use cloud services a lot in real life. When my phone is full, I can upload resources to the cloud, freeing up more storage for my phone, rather than deleting them. Or when I get a new phone or tablet, I can use the cloud to transfer data more easily. In terms of games, I am looking forward to Google STADIA platform very much. As I said before, I no longer need to spend a lot of money to buy game equipment, but only need a better network. All in all, I think cloud greatly facilitates our life.</p>

						                 <h5>what is robotics</h5>
						                <p>Robots provide efficient and practical utility for business and particularly for the military. Never sleeping, never tired, never bored, never having lack of motivation and never being sick. That is why robots are already preferred over humans in some areas.</p>
						                 <h5>What is the state and art of robotics</h5>
						                 <p>Abstract - The origin and the history of robotics are introduced, and the present status of robot progress, its significance and a new role of robot in human society are discussed. Nationwide research activities are reviewed and some of the research and development results are reported. The population of robot is rapidly increasing in advanced countries and the social impact of robot's diffusion must be carefully inspected. Finally, how to meet with a coming robot era from the standpoint of human society is considered.</p>

                                                                     - Robots must be able to make and execute their own decisions based on</p>
						                  <p>Sensor information 

                                                                      Intuitive Human-Robot Interfaces 

                                                                      - Use of robots in smart homes cannot require extensive user training 

                                                                       - Commands to robots should be natural for inhabitants</p>

                                                                      - Robots must be able to adjust to changes in the environment

						                <h5>Human-robot interaction</h5>
						                       <p>The state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures and facial expression, rather than an interface of command line. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot.</p>

						<h5> What can be done now in Robotics</h5>
						<p> Applications of Robots or Types of Robots-

                                             We can start working on these types of robots for the human help and we started today it takes so many years to complete it.</p>
						<h5> What is the potential impact of this development?</h5>
						<img src="robotics1.png" alt="robotics">
						<h5>1.) The Business Impact of Robotics on Our Lives</h5> 
							<p>Robots have a remarkable impact upon business around our world.  Human laborers are quickly finding themselves being replaced by robotic counterparts, who complete their jobs much more quickly and with near exact accuracy every time.  This gives businesses a huge advantage in output, costs, and overall profitability.  Robotic labour machines can produce vastly higher quantities than humans, creating higher supplies of finished goods.  The robots present manufacturers with a savings in costs as well, paying much fewer wages to humans and paying slightly higher overhead costs for electricity and machine upkeep.  With all these positives for robots in business, there are negatives as well.  A common fear among many inventors and engineers is that, eventually, the human workforce will altogether be replaced by robotic machines and human labour will not be needed at all.  These fears have been fueled by increasingly advanced robotic inventions in factories that have caused workers to be laid off, as well as commercial robotic products that complete simple labour tasks.  Simple human labour tasks such as mowing grass and cleaning swimming pools have already been replaced by robots, and many more skilled labour positions, such as industrial parts manufacturers, have begun to switch to precision robot labour units. </p>

 

                                                  <h5> 2.) The Social Impact of Robotics on our Lives </h5>

                                                     <p>   The group of people that will experience the biggest social impact of robots are children. Robots will enter schools and assist children in learning. But robots can also take over tasks. Children will quickly find out that robots are very good at making homework.</p>
